# README Generator


## About Application

This application is used to create a high quality readme file that the user can use for an application in which they make with instructions, info about the app, name, license used and contact info for the user.

## List of technologies used

- npm
- javascript
- node js
- .gitgnore

## User Story

For this homework, I had to create a way to create a high quality readme file for a specific application that the user has made. 

## My Task

My Task was to create a way for node to run in the terminal the index.js file.  With this file, it asks the questions with the npm 'inquirer'.  When the user enters the data, it will create a readme file with this information in a template that was created.

## Acceptance Citeria
```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and T![ests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
```
